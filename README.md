# üåê Ian Josia Mwarori - Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases who I am, my background, key affiliations, and some creative work. It reflects my journey as a tech-driven learner, an aspiring software developer, and an incoming student at NYU Shanghai. The website features a multi-page layout (Home, About, Projects, Contact), with responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile. It includes logos from the Power Learn Project, ELP Huawei Program, and NYU Shanghai, a 5x2 image gallery with comments, smooth hover effects, and a contact form ready for email setup. Technologies used include HTML5, CSS3, Git, GitHub, and VS Code. The folder contains index.html (Home), about.html, projects.html, contact.html, style.css, an images folder, and this README file. To run locally, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Portfolio-Website.git`, navigate into the folder with `cd "Portfolio Website"`, and open index.html in your browser. You can also deploy this on GitHub Pages to go live. Contact me at ianjosiamwarori@gmail.com. This project was built as part of the Power Learn Project Software Development Program (July 2025 Cohort) and my NYU Shanghai Pre-Departure Showcase. Last updated August 2025.
