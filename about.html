    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Steve Jobs once said that we can only connect the dots by looking backwards.<br> Life is 
    essentially a journey of solving problems. My name is Ian Mwarori, a Mirath scholar and incoming freshman at New York University; Shanghai.
  Enthusiastic about Africa’s innovation  potential . I’m on a mission to harness software and AI to transform lives. I aspire to inspire and involve the youth in educational programs. Whether its coding, mentoring or dreaming up the next African start up, I really crave for this inclusive future .I  dared to dream being  the richest man in Africa not just in wealth but in ideas and touching lives. A firm believer in giving back!</p>
    <p>My journey into technology was not linear, but it has been deeply intentional. I never saw a laptop not until I joined Mang’u. At first I couldn’t even make use of MS word. I was often more curious. Access to these digital tools was limited in my hometown. Through the Equity Group Foundation’s Wings To Fly program, I was not only empowered academically but also trained as a student mentor. A role that awakened in me a passion for using  knowledge to uplift others. I’ve since mentored dozens of students across Kenya encouraging both academic excellence and digital literacy

    <p>
On 10th November 2023, I wrote my very first lines of C++ code. That moment marked not just the start of my technical journey but the beginning of believing that I too could. How better would it be if I had known it 10 years ago? And my first thought? “I want someone else to feel this!”. The very next moment I taught my young brother Feisal to code at seven. Currently, I am a student at the PLP Africa Academy, a fully funded software development program. I’m gaining hands on skills in the MERN stack, python, database systems and mobile first development using Dart. Alongside this, I am independently pursuing the Stanford Machine Learning course online to deepen my understanding of AI.

Looking ahead I really aspire to build transformation systems. As a first generation student I’m researching to build education platforms for under-resourced communities. Coming up with a village wallet for family households to save for their children education. I want my code to carry meaning beyond the screen.</p>
